# Transcriptomic_analysis

To perform the transcriptomic analysis, the algorithm was divided into the following steps:

1st : OPEN THE "csv" FILES IN R THROUGH AN MATRIX EXPERIMENTAL

2nd : CREATE A FUNCTION THAT FILTERS THE DATA BY THE NUMBER OF READS OF EACH VARIANT

3rd: CREATE A DATA NORMALIZATION FUNCTION

4th : JOIN THE TWO FILES OF EACH PATIENT USING THE COMMON COLUMNS

5th : CREATE A VARIANTS CLASSIFICATION FUNCTION WITHIN FROM THE SAME PATIENTS

6th: JOIN THE TABLES OF TWO DIFFERENT PATIENTS

7th: FIND THE MAXIMUM VARIATION POINTS AMONG THE PATIENTS
